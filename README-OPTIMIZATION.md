# Image Optimization Implementation

## Phase 1: WebP Conversion & Lazy Loading ✅ COMPLETED

### What was implemented:

1. **WebP Conversion Script** (`scripts/optimize-images.js`)
   - Converts JPG, JPEG, PNG images to WebP format
   - Uses lossless compression for logos and transparent images
   - Uses 85% quality lossy compression for photos
   - Processes `/public/images`, `/public/lovable-uploads`, and `/src/assets` directories

2. **Enhanced LazyImage Component** (`src/components/ui/LazyImage.tsx`)
   - Added WebP support with fallback to original format
   - Improved intersection observer with 50px rootMargin
   - Added `fetchPriority` attribute for better loading
   - Enhanced error handling and placeholder states

3. **New OptimizedImage Component** (`src/components/ui/OptimizedImage.tsx`)
   - Dedicated component for optimized image rendering
   - WebP with fallback via `<picture>` element
   - Lazy loading with intersection observer
   - Aspect ratio preservation and smooth transitions

4. **Resource Optimization Hook** (`src/hooks/useResourceOptimization.ts`)
   - Updated to preload critical WebP images
   - Browser detection for WebP support
   - Fallback for older browsers

5. **Service Worker Enhancement** (`public/sw.js`)
   - Added WebP caching support
   - Cache both WebP and fallback formats
   - Enhanced image caching strategy

## How to run the optimization:

```bash
# Install Sharp for image processing
npm install sharp

# Run the optimization script
npm run optimize-images
```

## Phase 2: Font Optimization ✅ COMPLETED

### What was implemented:

1. **Reduced Font Variants**
   - Montserrat: Reduced from 9 weights (100-900) to 3 critical weights (400, 600, 700)
   - Poppins: Reduced from 9 weights (100-900) to 3 critical weights (400, 500, 600)
   - Size reduction: ~70% smaller font files

2. **Optimized Font Loading Strategy**
   - Added `rel="preload"` for critical font CSS
   - Implemented non-blocking CSS loading with media="print" trick
   - Added noscript fallback for accessibility

3. **Enhanced Font Display**
   - Set `font-display: swap` for faster text rendering
   - Added font-smoothing optimizations
   - Improved text rendering with optimizeLegibility

4. **Font Preloading Hook Enhancement**
   - Updated `useResourceOptimization.ts` to preload critical WOFF2 files
   - Targeted specific font files for better performance

5. **New FontOptimizer Component**
   - Dedicated component for font optimization
   - Reduces layout shift with proper font fallbacks
   - Optimizes text rendering across browsers

## Next Phases (Pending):

### Phase 3: JS/CSS Optimization
- Code splitting
- Minification
- Bundle analysis

### Phase 4: Analytics & Monitoring
- Google Analytics 4 integration
- Performance monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking

## Benefits Achieved:

- **WebP Format**: 25-35% smaller file sizes
- **Lazy Loading**: Faster initial page load
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Fallbacks for older browsers
- **Caching**: Optimized service worker caching
- **Better UX**: Smooth image transitions and placeholders
